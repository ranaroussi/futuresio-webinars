### Requirements:

All the code listed in the notebooks is compatible with Python 3.4+ and relies
on Python's scientific stack (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc).
The simplest way to get Python 3 installed on your mahcine,
is to install [Continuum's Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads),
which comes pre-loaded with 99% of what you need.

Once you have anaconda installed, I recommend installing a few more libraries,
in order to be able to run the code in the notebooks:

* [pandas-datareader](https://github.com/pydata/pandas-datareader) - to quickly fetch financial data
* [fix-yahoo-finance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/fix-yahoo-finance) - fixes Yahoo! finance historical data retreival
* [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org) - for nicer (and more complex) plots in less code

Install these libraries by opening your terminal (or cmd.exe in windows) and running the following commands:


```bash
$ pip install pandas-datareader
$ pip install fix-yahoo-finance
$ pip install seaborn
```
